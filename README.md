Sudoku Solver

Currently works just with 9x9 sudoku and 3x3 box standard sudokus. Theres a little bit of magic numbers in the code like 9 and 3 for this
but the solver seems to work with some basic cases.

It will just give the first solution only. Some hard sudokus such as one of the hard ones out of the ones in sudoku_mostconstrained.cpp
actually have two solutions both correct. So that sudokus might not always have one solution only. I just remembered it because the solver
gave different solution than at the back of the sudoku magazine answers page (so I think it was the sudoku_hard_118...

Ultimately some sudokus just dont have a single solution only.
